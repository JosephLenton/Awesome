Awesome Prolog Web Framework
============================

Prolog has been a language I've been very interested in for a while. I really like pushing languages, and how you can program. I do a lot of web programming, so this is a project in building a proper MVC framework in Prolog.

The intention is to build a framework good enough for real life usage, and I don't mean one of those ugly style ones used on backwater academic sites. As someone who uses modern tools and standards for my web work (HTML5 Boilerplate, jQuery, lots of HTML5 canvas, CSS3, RoR and various other MVC framework), I want to build something of a decent level.

This is my attempt.

Updates

Posts about direction, how it's coming along, my thoughts, what I think of Prolog, and so on are all posted in the wiki. It's my blog for this project; go check it out.

Structure
---------

The core framework lives under 'src', whilst an example application is built at 'example'. In practice they would live under the same root, but this allows me to build in multiple examples which all work off the same current version of 'awesome'.
